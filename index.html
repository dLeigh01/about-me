        <p>My name is <strong>Dana Leigh Huffman</strong>, I'm 23 years old, and I've lived here in <strong>Washington</strong> with my mom, dad, and brother for my entire life.</p><br />
  
        <p>When I was younger, I wanted to be a cop. My grandfather was a DEA agent and I just thought he was the coolest person on earth. Throughout the years, I stuck to that goal for the most part, occasionally deviating to consider a career as an artist, or an astronaut, or maybe a veterinarian, but I always came back in the end.</p><br />
  
        <p>In my third year of high school, <i>(during which I was once again considering going to veterinary school, but that ended when I shadowed a vet for a day and realized I would never have it in me to put an animal down.)</i> I was diagnosed with ADD. This was almost a relief, since I had failed a class for the first time the year prior and everyone had always just chalked up my issues to me being lazy. By the time I had graduated and left for college I realized medication really wasn't helping me to focus and had stopped getting refills. I went to <strong>Washington State University</strong>, as they had one of the best criminal justice programs in the state, but I ended up being put on academic probation after one semester and never went back.</p><br />

        <p>I tried my luck at a nearby community college and attended a few years there while working a couple of different jobs <i>(mostly retail and food service)</i>, and that is where I discovered coding. I had dabbled in code in the past, having attempted to make 32bit video games in simplified code with a dedicated program back when I was in high school, but until this point I had never worked with real code. I fell in love instantly and ended up taking a second C++ course after the first, even though it wouldn't help my credit count. When I realized that, once again, I was pretty certain I would never be able to finish the classes I needed to get my degree, I decided to switch tracks entirely and go to <strong>Code Fellows</strong>.</p><br />

        <p>At that point, I had been working in retail for about a year and a half, and I ended up losing my job when the store shut down right before I was meant to start school again... and then the whole country shut down soon after when COVID hit. My 201 class that was due to start in a few weeks had been switched to an online format and, terrified that I'd mess it all up as was the norm when I had to do work in my own home, I decided to wait. As the pandemic dragged on, I ended up with a new job, once again in retail, and made sure the manager knew I would likely only be there for a few months and then I would be going back to school. <i>Another</i> year and a half later I realized that if I didn't at least try online school I was going to be stuck in retail forever. So I quit.</p><br />

        <p>Being here now, I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel. For all my nerves over how I was possibly going to get through this, the two years I spent away from any sort of school for the first time in my life gave me a better ability to figure out how to work around my ADD to do things I actually wanted to do, and through that I've been able to get better at doing things I might be ambivalent towards as well. I hope to get better still going through this entire program and I just want to become the best that I can possibly be in regards to coding. I'm not quite sure where I want to take this in the end, but I want to figure out what I'm best at and love to do the most on my way and just go from there.</p>
