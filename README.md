### Reflections

All-in-all, once I got used to the fact that all the CSS had been stripped, this actually became easier to work with. The only issue I had was trying to figure out how to italicize text ~~and I'd also forgotten how to do a manual line break but I remembered it was in my notes~~ and change the distance between lines, which wasn't 100% necessary, but I felt like it was kind of cramped and wanted to figure out how to do it. The javascript portion didn't give me any trouble and I feel like I am getting better at determining the correct tags for things in HTML.

### Reflections 2

Well, I was moderately disappointed today when I looked to figure out how to check against all items in an array at once and then had to restructure my whole last question when I realized I wasn't supposed to use it. Other than that, this was great practice with loops and I learned how to style list items. I also hopefully will never put a prompt without assigning it to a variable ever again after I did it like 8 times and could not figure out what was wrong for the life of me until I went and rubber-ducked with my table mates.
