### Reflections

All-in-all, once I got used to the fact that all the CSS had been stripped, this actually became easier to work with. The only issue I had was trying to figure out how to italicize text ~~and I'd also forgotten how to do a manual line break but I remembered it was in my notes~~ and change the distance between lines, which wasn't 100% necessary, but I felt like it was kind of cramped and wanted to figure out how to do it. The javascript portion didn't give me any trouble and I feel like I am getting better at determining the correct tags for things in HTML.
